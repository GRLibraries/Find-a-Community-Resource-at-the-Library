# Find a Community Resource at the Library

[Find a Community Resource at the Library](https://cwrigh13.github.io/Find-a-Community-Resource-at-the-Library/ "Find a Community Resource at the Library") is an accessible, multilingual web application designed to help Georges River Libraries customers find local community services. This tool features a dynamic map and a filterable list directory, making it easy to locate support organisations based on language and service category.

## **Features**

* **Interactive Map:** Visualise the locations of community services on an interactive map, powered by Leaflet.js.

* **Dual Filtering System:** Easily filter services by:

* **Language:** Select from multiple languages to find services that cater to specific linguistic needs. English-language services are always displayed as a baseline.

* **Category:** Choose from a comprehensive list of service categories (e.g., First Nations, Health & Wellbeing, Youth Services).

* **Dynamic Content:** The map pins and the service directory list update instantly based on your filter selections.

* **Service Directory:** A scrollable list provides an alternative, accessible view of the filtered organisations, perfect for services without a fixed physical address.

* **Detailed Information Cards:** Each organisation in the list and on the map has a detailed card displaying:

   * Name & Description
   * Address, Phone & Email
   * A scannable QR Code that links directly to the organisation's website.

* **Multilingual Interface:** The entire user interface, including headings, buttons, and service descriptions, is pre-translated and updates instantly when a new language is selected.

* **Animated Header:** The main title dynamically scrolls through the available service categories to showcase the breadth of resources.

* **Responsive Design:** The layout is designed with a two-column view for desktops and gracefully adapts to a single-column view on smaller screens for a seamless mobile experience.
